            <span class="numbers">1. Stock Market Trading</span>
            <br><br>
            <p>I heard this from my cousin back in 2018. Somehow she was able to encourage me to learn more about stock market trading. She sent me a pdf copy of a book about the stock market and there I saw the wide range of possibilities and bright opportunities offered by this field, which is why I started learning more about it. I watched videos from YouTube and I studied in an online course where I learned some of the basics like technical analysis, risk management, tools, indicators and trading psychology. I still don't have any experience or practice but it is one of the things I plan to do in the future.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p>I like to travel around the world and try exciting things like sky diving, mountain climbing and sea surfing. Inspired by documentaries, shows and vlogs about world travel, I try to discover many things including the benefits and risks of traveling almost everywhere, where to go and where not to and where I can find specifically that matter. I also like to taste delicious food in every place, buy souvenirs, take pictures and enjoy life. Learning things like culture and traditions from different places to understand them and finding beauty in the differences on the things I will discover someday will fascinate my soul forever.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p>I am not confident with how my voice sounds but since I am an avid fan of anime ever since I was young, I've grown deeply fond of voice acting my favorite anime characters and copying their signature lines and imitating ultimate moves like Goku's Kamehamewave, Naruto's Kage bunshin no jutsu, Gon's jajanken and many more. To be able to make Filipino versions of animes that is yet to be premiered in the future is one of my goals in life.</p>

            <span class="numbers">4. Game Development</span>
            <br><br>
            <p>I always loved to play games as a kid and sometimes think (On some games) that "if only this game would be more challenging like others" or "if only this game has this option or feature then it would be a better game to play" and then I found out that there are ways to do exactly what I wanted to do. To make a game where I can express my Ideas, create my own storyline, customize the characters, adjust the settings, design the game's concept and making some cool sound effects is something that I think I would be enjoying in the future.</p>

            <span class="numbers">5. Video Edtiting</span>
            <br><br>
            <p>I started editing videos back in 2018 using my android phone. At first, I was just editing videos for school activities purposes and eventually explored the tools and tried editing funny videos. Editing funny videos and birthday greeting videos for my friends is one of my hobbies now and my interest in this work became more profound when I found out that video creators and video editors were in demand especially when the pandemic began because one of people's way of coping from the stress is watching videos that entertain us, educate us and make our attention drift away.</p>
